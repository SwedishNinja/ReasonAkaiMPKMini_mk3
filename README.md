# Reason AkaiMPKMini_mk3

This an unofficial control surface configuration for the AKAI MPC mini MK3 for Reason 12.

### 1. Install the files

   The files here should be installed in the following directory
   Win:
   C:\ProgramData\Propellerhead Software\Remote\
   Mac:
   I dont own a Mac but somewhere under "Application Support" maybe.

### 2. Start Reason

### 3. Edit -> Preferences -> Control Surfaces
   Use "Add manually" Button
   Select Manufacturer: "NotAKAI"
   Select Model: "MPK mini mk3"
   In Port: "MPK mini 3"
   
   If you do not see the NotAKAI Manufacturer make sure the files are in the correct locations.
   
### 4. You have to reprogram your AKAI MPK Mini mk3 to use all "Relative" settings for the knobs. 
   The software is supplied by Akai. 
   
### 5. Knob MIDI IDs are set to "46" through "4d" (70 to 77 dec). This can be setup in the Akai Software also.
